            <h2>Artifact 1: The Space Between</h2>
            <p>This is a game I worked on as part of my coursework. It was a collaborative project where we created a 2D
                platformer.</p>

            <p>Wait a minute. Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?<br>
                This is heavy. Why don't you make like a tree and get outta here? I think the woman was born a nun.<br>
                I'm your density. I mean your destiny. Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born. If my
                calculations <br>
                are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious sh*t. I guess you guys
                aren't<br>
                ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.</p>

            <p>And to that, I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world
                alone.<br>
                It is useless to meet revenge with revenge. It will heal nothing. This day does not belong to one man
                but to all.<br>
                Let us together rebuild this world that we may share in the days of peace. It is a strange fate that we
                should suffer<br>
                so much fear and doubt over so small a thing, such a little thing. Not all those who wander are lost.
                And to that, I hold.<br>
                I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone. Death is just
                another path, one that<br>
                we all must take. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world. Small hands do
                them because they<br>
                must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.</p>
