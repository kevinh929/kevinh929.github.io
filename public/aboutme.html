            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>My name is Kevin Hoagland, and I am a game design student at Boise State University! I am just about to
                finish my sophomore year. I am looking forward to summer break and the upcoming fall semester! I am a
                passionate gamer and game developer, and I enjoy playing and creating games that I can share with
                others! My main development focus is in Unity, but I plan to learn Unreal over the Summer as well. My
                favorite games are currently Overwatch 2 and Minecraft with Destiny 2 sprinkled in but has taken the
                back burner post Final Shape. I occasionally stream on Twitch and YouTube, but I am looking to get back
                into it over the summer as a way to document my progress on my projects and share them with others! The
                thing that drives me to keep moving towards game development and learning the skills I need to be
                successful is the idea of creating something that others can enjoy and share with their friends and
                family. I want to be able to create games that people can play and enjoy, and I want to be able to share
                my passion for gaming with others.
