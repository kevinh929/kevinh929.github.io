                <h2 class="titleDes">Fall 2024</h2>
                <h3 class="subtitleDes">Top Down 2D Interactive Comic</h3>
                <p>The Space Between is a Top Down 2D Interactive Comic, based on the idea of Conciousness, Death and
                    the Implications of Quantum Mechanics.
                    This project was created by myself and a team of 3 other students at Boise State University for the
                    GIMM 250 Class.
                    In order to create the game, we started with a blank 2D unity project and designed the game from the
                    ground up.
                    The game was created in Unity and uses C# for the code. The art assets outside the comic panels were
                    all done in Aseprite and the comic panels were created in Adobe Photoshop.
                    We utilized a variety of Unity tools including but not limited to: Unity's Animation system, the
                    Tilemap system, the UI sytem, the New Input system and cinemachine.
                    I was responsible for the Github repository, a majority of the code and 4 of the comic panels you
                    see within the game.
                    Below you can find a video of the teams reflection, a download for the game and a link to the Github
                    repository.

                <p>Wait a minute. Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?
                    This is heavy. Why don't you make like a tree and get outta here? I think the woman was born a nun.
                    I'm your density. I mean your destiny. Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born. If my
                    calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious sh*t.
                    I
                    guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.

                <p>And to that, I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world
                    alone.
                    It is useless to meet revenge with revenge. It will heal nothing. This day does not belong to one
                    man
                    but to all.
                    Let us together rebuild this world that we may share in the days of peace. It is a strange fate that
                    we
                    should suffer
                    so much fear and doubt over so small a thing, such a little thing. Not all those who wander are
                    lost.
                    And to that, I hold.
                    I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone. Death is just
                    another path, one that
                    we all must take. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world. Small hands
                    do
                    them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.</p>
