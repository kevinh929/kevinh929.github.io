                <h3 class="subtitleDes">3rd Person 3D Platformer</h3>
                <p>
                    Battricks Analog Adventure is a 3rd Person 3D platformer about a robot going on an adventure
                    through the Analog world with the goal of stopping the viruses that have taken refuge in this world
                    after fleeing the digital world. Along the way, they traverse the area that is built out of old film
                    reels, media players, and other various things that fit the theme of old dilapidated technology. He
                    hops through filmstrips that take him to new locations that have their own types of enemies and sub
                    themes. With many secrets and lore tidbits hidden around about Battricks home as well as why the
                    Viruses fled, Battrick begins to learn what their goal is, and where the viruses came from.

                <h2 class="titleDes">Spring 2024</h2>
                <h3 class="subtitleDes">Top Down 2D Interactive Comic</h3>
                <p>The Space Between is a Top Down 2D Interactive Comic, based on the idea of Conciousness, Death
                    and
                    the Implications of Quantum Mechanics.
                    This project was created by myself and a team of 3 other students at Boise State University for
                    the
                    GIMM 250 Class.
                    In order to create the game, we started with a blank 2D unity project and designed the game from
                    the
                    ground up.
                    The game was created in Unity and uses C# for the code. The art assets outside the comic panels
                    were
                    all done in Aseprite and the comic panels were created in Adobe Photoshop.
                    We utilized a variety of Unity tools including but not limited to: Unity's Animation system, the
                    Tilemap system, the UI sytem, the New Input system and cinemachine.
                    I was responsible for the Github repository, a majority of the code and 4 of the comic panels
                    you
                    see within the game.
                    Below you can find a video of the teams reflection, a download for the game and a link to the
                    Github
                    repository.

                <h2>Unity 2D AR Platformer</h2>
                <h2 class="titleDes">Winter 2023</h2>
                <h3 class="subtitleDes">AR 2D Platformer</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was created by myself and a team of three other students in the matter of about 4
                    weeks.
                    It took place in the GIMM 110 class and the idea was to take elements from the 2D games we all made
                    previously in the semester and combine aspects of them into a single game that also tied an AR
                    mechanic
                    into the game. The game was created in Unity and used Vuforia for the AR aspect of the game. The AR
                    was used so that if you scanned specific images, it would open a 2D platformer that you could play
                    on your phone. This was alos my first experience using Github and Trello for project management.
                    While the process was a bit rocky throughout the projects, I learned a lot about how to work with a
                    team and how to handle team dynamics.

                <h2 class="titleDes">Fall 2023</h2>
                <h3 class="subtitleDes">2D Platformer</h3>
                <p>
                    Cats Climb is a 2D platformer developed soley by me that was created in Unity and was my first
                    experience with Unity,
                    C# and programming as a whole. We were given a basic example game and were assigned the task of
                    transforming it into a 2D game based upon the original blueprint. All artwork, mechanics, and
                    animations
                    were created by myself. The game was designed to be a simple platformer where you play as a cat
                    that climbs up the large building to collect gems, with the goal of getting the Prime Diamond
                    at the top of the building. Throughout the tower were various methods of parkour that
                    required the player to learn and master the movement mechanics all while also dodging the saw blades
                    placed throughout the level.
