            <h2>Most Recent Update!</h2>
            <p>As I'm writing this, I am wrapping up my sophomore spring semester and continuing the search for summer
                internships! Finals has been a rollercoaster
                of time management and overlapping schedules, but I'm happy to have it all be coming to a close! Over the
                summer I intend to shoot for a summer internship
                and have also thought about resuming streaming on Twitch and Youtube at a more regular interval. The idea
                there is to mix in playing games like Overwatch 2 and
                Minecraft with friends while also working on projects like my final project on stream as a way of both
                documenting my progress and sharing it with others!
                all in all, I plan to make this summer much better than my last, especially since I wont be bed-ridden
                from a serious knee injury!
