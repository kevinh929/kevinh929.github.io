            <p>This is a game I worked on as part of my coursework. It was a collaborative project where we created a 2D
                platformer.</p>

            <p>Wait a minute. Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?
                This is heavy. Why don't you make like a tree and get outta here? I think the woman was born a nun.
                I'm your density. I mean your destiny. Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born. If my
                calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious sh*t. I
                guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.

            <p>And to that, I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world
                alone.
                It is useless to meet revenge with revenge. It will heal nothing. This day does not belong to one man
                but to all.
                Let us together rebuild this world that we may share in the days of peace. It is a strange fate that we
                should suffer
                so much fear and doubt over so small a thing, such a little thing. Not all those who wander are lost.
                And to that, I hold.
                I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone. Death is just
                another path, one that
                we all must take. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world. Small hands do
                them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.</p>
