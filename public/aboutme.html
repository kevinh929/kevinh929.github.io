        <hr />
        <p>My name is Kevin Hoagland, and I am a game design student at Boise State University!
            I am just about to finish my sophomore year and am looking forward to summer break and the upcoming fall
            semester!
            I am a passionate gamer and game developer, and I enjoy playing and creating games that I can share with
            others!
            My main development focus is in Unity, but plan to learn Unreal over the Summer as well. My personal
            favorite games are
            currently Overwatch 2 and Minecraft with Destiny 2 sprinkled in, but has taken the back burner post Final
            Shape.
            I occasionally stream on Twitch and Youtube, but I am looking to get back into it over the summer as a way
            to document
            my progress on my projects and share them with others! The thing that drives me to keep moving towards game
            development and
            learning the skills I need to be successful is the idea of creating something that others can enjoy and
            share with their friends and family.
            I want to be able to create games that people can play and enjoy, and I want to be able to share my passion
            for gaming with others.
